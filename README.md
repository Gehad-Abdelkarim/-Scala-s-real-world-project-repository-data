# The GitHub History of the Scala Language
With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

## Answering the following questions:
1- Is the project still actively maintained?

2- Is there camaraderie in the project?

3-What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?

4-Who made the most pull requests to a given file?

5-Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file?
